# Tennessee-Promise-Program

Government agencies and private foundations distribute billions of dollars in financial aid to college-goers in hopes of boosting educational attainment. Tennessee, for example, guarantees no-cost tuition for all high school graduates at in-state community and technical colleges. In this exercise, I investigate the impact of the Tennessee Promise on college enrollment.

The first step is to assemble a data set tracking enrollment and aid awards at Tennessee colleges over time. The U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provides the data we need. 

The Tennessee Promise guarantees no-cost tuition for all Tennessee high school graduates who attend the state's public community and technical colleges. For the sake of concision, we'll refer to schools that offer bachelor's degrees as “four-year colleges” and schools that don't as “two-year colleges.” (We recognize that, in practice, time to degree completion varies widely across students and credentials). We'll also distinguish between public and private schools, so your analysis will compare four groups:
● public, two-year colleges
● public, four-year colleges
● private, two-year colleges
● private, four-year colleges
Given these categories, community and technical colleges will fall in the “public, two-year” group.
